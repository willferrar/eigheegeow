                            <p> I have had these two cards laying around for a long time and figured I should finally just sell them. ~~BFG Technologies GeForce 8800 GT 512MB GDDR3  ~~ SOLD PNY GeForce GTX 460 1GB GDDR5 256-Bit  Also just for something for you to know. the PNY GeForce GTX 460 1GB GDDR5 256-Bit is in extremely good condition. It is a little over 2 years old and it has never had any issues. The only "intensive" gaming I did on this card was really only World of Warcraft which honestly isn't. I took a bunch of older hardware in my closet and built a machine to play Rocksmith 2014 on, and nothing else. I set it up to automatically boot into Steam, and then Rocksmith 2014. It worked, but it booted so. very. slowly. I added delays in-between loading things at startup, and it seemed to help - it only took 2:45 to boot into Rocksmith menu screen. That still seems really slow for a Win10Pro/SSD install that has only a couple programs besides Steam and Rocksmith installed on it (brows.

I'm currently running a 512 MB Geforce 8800 GT (from BFG Technologies, if it helps). I've had it for about a year and a half now and until recently I've had no problems with it (it was capable of running Crysis on high at 1280 x 1024). However since I started playing Left 4 Dead 2 I've been having heat issues with it. I downloaded SpeedFan and ran a few games to test its running temp to find that it idles at 80C, and when playing games like World in Conflict 
As the market keeps on rolling, I'd like to make a post remembering the lost companies and the hardware no longer made.

So it would seem that BFG are no more and I am left with a GFX card that no longer works and £200 out of pocket. The RMA has been open since the 11th of july and now they tell me the above. Am I screwed.

While this isn't normally a bad thing, I'm worried what it might lead to. Like say Cro-magnon running around with a BFG 9000 hunting Mammoths daily.
