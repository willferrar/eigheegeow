It's been too long since the last essentials list. Here's a list of all PC videogames with both metacritic user and metascores above 75. Just made for myself and thought someone may appreciate. Copypastable and sortable, on a single page.

Just because I'm bored at work today, I compiled a list of every PC game that scored an 85+ on metacritic for the past 20 years. Obviously this list should be taken with a grain of salt, especially for older games since metacritic didn't even start until 1999 and there weren't nearly as many sites reviewing games back when the internet was still picking up steam. As a disclaimer, I only pulled PC games because those are the ones I'm personally most interested in and the fact that a lot of these.

I had the idea for some time to create a list of all the known flight sims. I'm excluding specific versions of a sim (FSX, Fs2004, etc) instead I'm naming the series. I'm also excluding flight simulators that are very old. The point is to provide a list of flight simulators that are viable options. #Combat Flight Simulators - IL-2 Sturmovik - War Thunder (simulation mode) - Rise of Flight - Digital Combat Simulator - Falcon BMS - Enemy Engaged - Aces High. #Avation Flight Simulators - X-Plane.

In 2011 I got the flight sim bug, I invested in a saitek yoke, side throttle panel, and rudder pedals. I also picked up a book called "Microsoft Flight Simulator X For Pilots Real World Training" (I have no affiliation with the author or publish and don't care if you purchase the book or not!) I loved this book, it did a great job teaching flight (at least sim flight) in a step by step method. It treated the course like a real life flight course and had you learn and practice important skills. All this hubbub about the SimCity DRM made me think about the decline of big-budget PC-gaming over the years. I went through a list of all the major publishers and logged all of the PC-exclusive games that they've made over the years. Anno 1503 (2002) Battlefield 1942 (2002) Command & Conquer: Renegade (2002) Earth & Beyond (2002) Freedom Force (2002) Global Operations (2002) Matt Hayes Fishing (2002) Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (2002) Sid Meier's SimGolf. Because one of the usual clichés around PC gaming is the lack of game exclusives I've decided to look into metacritic.com and list all the games with 80 and over score from 2006 till now. Keep in mind: I have considered a PC exclusive all the titles without a console version, so if a mobile/tablet or mac version already exists I have still considered exclusive. So, let's see: 2014 Kentucky Route Zero - Act III Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft Year Walk SMITE The Blackwell. Where possible use my trade offer url, otherwise add me, pm me or comment below.
